# 💊 Drug Release Simulation

This project simulates drug release kinetics using **zero-order** and **first-order** models commonly applied in pharmaceutical formulations and drug delivery systems such as microneedles, transdermal patches, and oral dosage forms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to model and compare drug release profiles under two widely studied kinetic models:

- **Zero-Order Kinetics**: Constant release rate over time (e.g., ideal for controlled release systems)
- **First-Order Kinetics**: Release rate is proportional to the remaining drug concentration

This simulation provides a visual and quantitative tool to understand how different release mechanisms behave over time, with potential applications in optimizing drug delivery devices.

## ⚙️ Features

- Simulates drug release over time for:
  - Zero-order kinetics
  - First-order kinetics
- Plots concentration vs. time for both models
- Adjustable parameters: dose, rate constants, duration
- Clean, reusable Python code
