# Project 1: Drug Release Simulation

![Drug Release Simulation Thumbnail](thumbnail.png)

## Overview
This project simulates and compares drug release kinetics for first-order and zero-order models using Python. It aims to provide insights into drug delivery systems relevant to biomedical engineering, particularly in microneedle technology.

## Objectives
- Visualize and analyze drug release profiles over time.
- Compare burst release (first-order) and sustained release (zero-order).

## Results
