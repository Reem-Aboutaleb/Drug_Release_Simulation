# 💊 Drug Release Simulation: First-Order vs. Zero-Order Kinetics

This project simulates and compares **drug release kinetics** using two fundamental models: **first-order (burst release)** and **zero-order (sustained release)**. These simulations are highly relevant to **microneedle-based delivery systems** in biomedical engineering.

## 🧠 Overview

Drug delivery systems rely on precise control over release rates. This simulation explores how first-order and zero-order kinetics behave under the same initial conditions — helping biomedical engineers evaluate which release model is better suited for different applications such as pain management or sustained hormone delivery.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate first-order (burst) and zero-order (sustained) drug release kinetics  
- Visualize time-based release profiles  
- Compare behaviors across dose duration  
- Provide code for future modeling with real microneedle systems

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Simulates drug release over time for both kinetic models  
- ✅ Clear side-by-side graph for burst vs. sustained release  
- ✅ Modular Python code for easy editing  
- ✅ Clean plot output using Matplotlib

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Languages**: Python 3.11  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Concepts**: Pharmacokinetics, controlled release, mathematical modeling

## 📊 Results

### 📈 Release Profiles

- **First-Order**: Rapid initial release, then tapering  
- **Zero-Order**: Steady, controlled release over time  

These insights are crucial for determining drug delivery strategies in **microneedle-based patches, implants, or oral systems**.
