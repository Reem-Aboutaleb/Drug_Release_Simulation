# Project 1: Drug Release Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates and compares drug release kinetics for first-order and zero-order models using Python. It aims to provide insights into drug delivery systems relevant to biomedical engineering, particularly in microneedle technology.

## Objectives
- Visualize and analyze drug release profiles over time.
- Compare burst release (first-order) and sustained release (zero-order).

## Key Features
- Python-based simulation of drug release models.
- Clear visualization of release kinetics with annotated graphs.
- Demonstrates understanding of core drug delivery concepts.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Techniques:** Mathematical modeling, data visualization

## Results

- **First-Order Release:** Ideal for rapid drug delivery.
- **Zero-Order Release:** Suitable for sustained, controlled release.
